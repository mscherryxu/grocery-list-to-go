# Grocery List To-Go

Have you ever bought the same grocery item on the grocery list that your roommate/family purchased? 

## Fear not!

With Grocery List To-Go, you will have a list you can share with others that updates in real-time. If someone already purchased an item, they can remove it off the shared list, and you'll get the update as soon as it happens. You can also add items you want to add to the list in real-time too!
